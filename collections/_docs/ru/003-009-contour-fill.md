## What it is

Contour fill covers areas with stitches following the contour of an object.

## How to Create

Create a **closed path with a fill color**.

## Set Start and End Point

Set start and end points for autofill objects with [Visual commands](/docs/commands/).

## Params

Run `Extensions > Ink/Stitch  > Params`. Set fill method to `Contour Fill` and tweak the settings to your needs.

Read detailed information in the [Contour Fill Params](/docs/params/#contour-fill-params) section.

## Underlay

Underlay in Countour Fill doesn't follow the contour, but uses the fill angle which can be defined in the underlay [params](/docs/params/#fill-underlay).
