**Info**: This is not a general standard setting, it will only apply to the document on which you have run this function.
{: .notice--info }

The preferences are found in `Extensions > Ink/Stitch > Preferences`.

## Output Settings

* Collapse lenght (mm): Jump stitches smaller than this will be treated as normal stitches (without lock stitches).
* Minimal stitch length (mm): Stitches smaller than this value will be dropped (exception: lock stitches).

  **W6 machine owners:** Use at least a minimum value of *0.3 mm on each design*, otherwise your stitch out may have missing stitches where you wouldn't expect them.
