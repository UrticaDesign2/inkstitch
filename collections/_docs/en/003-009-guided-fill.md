## What it is

Generate curved fill with guide lines.

## How to Create

* Create a **closed path with a fill color**.
* Create a guide line to define stitch directions:
    * draw a line with a stroke color and without a fill color
    * select that line
    * run `Extensions > Ink/Stitch > Edit > Selection to guide line`
* Select both and group them together (`Ctrl + G`).
  Each group is allowed to contain more than one fill object, but only one guide line.
  Ã¤Additional guide lines will be ignored.
* Open the params dialog (`Extensions > Ink/Stitch > Params`) and select `Guided fill` as the fill method.

## Set Start and End Point

Set start and end points for autofill objects with [Visual commands](/docs/commands/).

## Params

Run `Extensions > Ink/Stitch  > Params` to tweak the settings to your needs.

Read detailed information in the [Guided Fill Params](/docs/params/#guided-fill-params) section.

## Underlay

Underlay in Guided Fill doesn't follow the guide line, but uses the fill angle which can be defined in the underlay [params](/docs/params/#fill-underlay).
