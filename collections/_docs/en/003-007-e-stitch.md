## What it is

It's biggest purpose is for a simple (and yet deceivingly strong) cover stitch for applique items. Mainly for baby cloths as their skin tends to be more sensitive.

## How to Create

Prepare your path exactly as you would with a [Satin Column](/docs/stitches/satin-column). But in Params enable `"E" stitch`. Don't forget to enlarge the zig-zag spacing for this stitch type.

**Tip:** If the points are facing the wrong way, just use the ["flip satin column rails"](/docs/satin-tools/#flip-satin-column-rails) extension.
