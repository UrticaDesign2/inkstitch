## Faux Fill Blend

1. A faux blend has a regular fill layer on bottom and each subsequent layer has variable density settings
2. Make sure that all of the layers have the same stitch angle, this allows for blending to happen
3. When doing more then 2 layers, each blending layer uses less density then the previous layer
4. Make sure to follow the same start and end points for each layer.  For instance, if the base layer starts at top top and ends at bottom right, follow that same sequence for each layer.
5. Underlay is typically not needed, but it does depend on the individual project.
6. Typically, it is best to work from light to dark colors, but again it does depend on the design and the desired end look.
7. While this is not a true blend, in most instances, this type of blend is good enough to achieve the desired end look.
8. The density values in this example are not set in stone, but just to illustrate the concept.  True settings will depend on the design, fabric it's going on and the size of design.

## True Blend

1. Many of the conditions of faux blends also apply here.  Stitch angle, start/end sequencing, typically go from light to dark colors (depends on the design as well)
2. Biggest difference is math is involved and the more complicated the blend, the more complicated the math.  Just have to make sure that each layer for a given section equals 100% of the density for that section that you are wanting.
3. This can involve more layers of colors and more increments of density variation.  The biggest factor is the size/shape of the design and the specifics of the project.
4. What makes this a true blend compared to a faux blend is that each section of the layers are actually mixing with each other.

## End Row Spacing

Ink/Stitch has a hidden feature to perform color blending.
