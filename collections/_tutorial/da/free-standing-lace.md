## Instructions

1. For free standing lace, the areas that would be for traditional fills are going to be for 2 layers of loose fill with opposing angles.  For instance, one loose fill would have 0 degree angle and the second layer would have 90 degree angle.
2. Experiment with different density levels and stitch angles to attach different looks and affects.
3. For detail work and outline work, use a decent size satin stitch.  Satin stitch outlines are required as that helps "seal" the edges and keep the design together after the solvy stabilizer is removed.
4. For the actual embroidery, use solvy and I prefer heavy weight solvy, usually with two layers of stabilizer. Depending on the brand, may still have to use more even with it being heavy weight. Just have to experiement to find out what is needed.
5. Following the instructions on the stabilizer for removal.  I tend to like to have a little of the stabilizer left and to try not to remove all of it.  This allows for some stiffness to remain in the finished product.
6. Enjoy your new FSL ornament.
