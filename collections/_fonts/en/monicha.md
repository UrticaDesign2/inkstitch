MONICHA is our first font with alternative characters.
.
For instance, these are different way to write the firstname Sasha

In addition to the regular character set, Monicha contains 50 alternative swash lower case letters.

To use these alternative letters, you will need to cut  their code from here and paste it in the lettering dialog.


To access one of the 26 little swash  lower case letters, use one these codes:


⒜	⒝	⒞	⒟	⒠	⒡

⒢	⒣	⒤	⒥	⒦	

⒧	⒨	⒩	⒪	⒫

⒬	⒭	⒮	⒯	⒰

⒱	⒲	⒳	⒴	⒵


There are also 11 lower case letters with long underscoring swash a-d-h-i-k-l-m-n-r-t-u :

They must not be followed, over two letters, by downslope letters (such as g-j-p-q-y-z)
to avoid satin columns overlays. To access use one of these codes:

Ⓐ			Ⓓ

	Ⓗ	Ⓘ		Ⓚ
	
Ⓛ	Ⓜ	Ⓝ

	Ⓡ		Ⓣ	Ⓤ


There are 3 underscore medium length swash letters g-j-y.

ⓖ ⓙ ⓨ

satin columns overlays.
