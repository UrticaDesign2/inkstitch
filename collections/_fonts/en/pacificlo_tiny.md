This is part of an upcoming Ink/Stitch version and not available in Ink/Stitch v2.1.2

## Description

This font is a variation of Pacificlo. 

The letters appear to be the same, but embroidery parameters are different. 

Density, pull compensation and underlays have been modified to allow a smaller size than the initial font smallest allowed size.


## Use
### Dimension

That's why in the lettering dialog window, you will have to pick up a scale between 25 and 55%. 
That percentage is  relatively to the original Pacificlo font, going from 20mm letters to anything between 5 and 12mm.


## Materiel Ã  utiliser

This smallified font **MUST** be embroidered with thread and needle smaller than usual.
A USA 8 (EUR 60) size needle, and 60WT thread **MUST** be used.
