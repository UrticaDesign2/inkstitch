This is part of an upcoming Ink/Stitch version and not available in Ink/Stitch v2.1.2

## Description

This font is a variation of Grand Hotel Marif. 

The letters appear to be the same, but embroidery parameters are different. 

Density, pull compensation and underlays have been modified to allow for  a smaller size than the initial font smallest recommanded size.

In addition to the software modification, you will need to use smaller thread and needle to successfully embroider this font.
