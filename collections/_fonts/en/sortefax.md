## Description

### Sortefax XL Initials
Sortefax XL Initials is meant to be used one letter at a time.
To get a framed letter, simply type the letter and any "frame" letter in the lettering dialog window (same line, no space).

Beware, not all frames can directly be used with all letters, in particular large letters such as M or W, or tall letters such as J.

Of course, using Inkscape,  you may easily reposition the frame or resize it or even transform a circle frame  into an ellipse for a tall letter.

### Sortefax Medium Initials
Sortefax Médium Initials is  smaller but  also simplier.

It is still possible to use frames, but the arranging of the frame and the letter is  not as good as for the XL font.
But this font may be used to write whole words with a correct kerning and not only single letters.
