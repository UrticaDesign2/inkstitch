## Description


This font is a variation of Amitaclo.

The letters appear to be the same, but embroidery parameters are different. 

Density, pull compensation and underlays have been modified to allow for a smaller size than the initial font smallest allowed size.

## Use
### Dimension

That's why in the lettering dialog window, you will have to pick up a scale between 25 and 55%. 
That percentage is  relatively to the original Amitaclo font, going from 30mm  (1 inch) letters to anything between 7 and 12 mm (1/4 to 1/2 inch)


### Thread and Needle

This smallified font **MUST** be embroidered with thread and needle smaller than usual.
A USA 8 (EUR 60) size needle, and 60WT thread **MUST** be used.
