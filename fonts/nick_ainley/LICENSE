The authors "Seniors Studio" has been contacted by Tina Chris:
"Dear Senior Studio Team
We would like to use an embroidery-adapted version of your font in an official release of Inkstitch (https://inkstitch.org/fonts/font-library/). The license does not clearly state if this is allowed. So we would kindly ask if you would allow it? If yes, should we put something special in the license, or change the name?
Thanks
Tina"

Seniors Studio accepted the use of the NickAinley font in a mail:
"Yes, you allowed :)"
